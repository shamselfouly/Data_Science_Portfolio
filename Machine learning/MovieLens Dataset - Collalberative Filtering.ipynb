    "**What is Model-based CF**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based Collaborative Filtering is based on **matrix factorization (MF)** which is an unsupervised learning method for latent variable decomposition and dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is widely used for recommender systems where it can **deal better with scalability and sparsity than Memory-based CF**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a very sparse matrix, with a lot of dimensions, by doing matrix factorization you can restructure the user-item matrix into low-rank structure, and you can represent the matrix by the multiplication of two low-rank matrices, where the rows contain the latent vector. You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example of the learned latent preferences of the users and items: let's say for the MovieLens dataset you have the following information: _(user id, age, location, gender, movie id, director, actor, language, year, rating)_. By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are _age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90)_, _location_ and _gender_, and for movie features it learns that _decade_, _director_ and _actor_ are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the _decade_, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features. \n",
