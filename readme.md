## Online Testing Methods
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/shamselfouly/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Online%20Testing%20Methods/Data/ab_testing.jpeg"> **[A/B Testing](https://github.com/shamselfouly/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Online%20Testing%20Methods/AB%20Testing/AB-Testing.ipynb)**

In this project we go through a website optimization senerio where we test whether a website interface change will lead to statictically & practically significant postive results. The test will start with selecting metrics to serves as sanity checks and also to act as a proxy to measure the change we are implementing. Afterwards, we assess metric variability and calculate sample size & expected experiment duration. We then analyze the experiment by perfroming first the sanity checks & then calculate propability changes between control & experimental groups, and finally, assess the significance of the results.

In this project we apply causal inference to understand what factors cause a hotel booking to be cancelled using the hotel bookings dataset from Antonio, Almeida and Nunes (2019). The analysis starts with some data cleaning & feature engineering to prepare the data. Afterward we apply the four steps of Causal Inference which include modeling causal mechanisms, identifing target estimand, estimating causal effect & finally refuting estimate
